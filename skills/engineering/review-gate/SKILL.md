description: Run an independent semantic review gate before merging non-trivial work, on top of (not duplicating) Alibaba Code Review and CI. Use after implementation and verification, especially for medium/high-risk changes.

# Review Gate

Use this after implementation and before merge.

## Division of Labor

- **Mechanical checks — owned by Alibaba Code Review and CI**: linting, formatting, conventional style, and straightforward static-analysis findings. Alibaba Code Review's output is recorded via `ai-agent-pr-metadata`.
- **Semantic review — owned by this gate**: requirements compliance, correctness, regressions, security/authorization, contract/integration risk, and acceptance-test adequacy — everything mechanical tooling can't judge.

## Workflow

1. Confirm linked issue and acceptance criteria.
2. Confirm verification commands and results.
3. Read Alibaba Code Review's findings and the GitHub CI/check results on the PR before starting the independent review — don't re-derive what's already there.
4. Review spec compliance before code style.
5. Check business logic and edge cases, regressions and compatibility, security and authorization, API/database/queue/integration contracts, and test adequacy including missing acceptance tests (see [canonical reviewer scope checklist](references/reviewer-scope-checklist.md)).
6. Revisit an Alibaba Code Review or CI finding only when it indicates an unresolved correctness, security, data-loss, configuration, or acceptance-criteria issue — not to relitigate style or formatting.
7. Post concrete findings or explicitly state no blocking issues. Do not repeat resolved lint, formatting, conventional-style, or straightforward static-analysis findings Alibaba Code Review or CI already covered.
8. Apply review findings before merge.

## Two-Axis Review Structure

Review along two independent axes and report findings under separate headers:

1. **Spec Compliance Axis**: Does the diff satisfy every acceptance criterion and expected behavior without scope creep or missed edge cases?
2. **Standards & Code Quality Axis**: Does the code adhere to this repository's conventions, architecture patterns, and semantic quality standards?

**Rule**: Never cross-rerank findings across the two axes. A change can cleanly follow conventions yet fail the spec, or satisfy the spec while violating architectural standards. Evaluate both independently.

## Semantic Smell Baseline (12 Fowler Smells)

Use these 12 smells as semantic heuristics during review. Documented repository standards always override these heuristics, and mechanical checks owned by CI/OCR must be skipped:

1. **Mysterious Name**: Unclear variable, function, or class name → rename to reflect intent and domain concepts.
2. **Duplicated Code**: Identical or near-identical logic in multiple places → extract helper or shared abstraction.
3. **Feature Envy**: Function queries another object's data more than its own → move behavior closer to data.
4. **Data Clumps**: Same group of primitives repeatedly passed together → group into a value object or struct.
5. **Primitive Obsession**: Raw strings/ints used for rich domain concepts → encapsulate in small value objects.
6. **Repeated Switches**: Same `switch` or `match` on type codes scattered across files → use polymorphism or strategy pattern.
7. **Shotgun Surgery**: One change forces many small edits across multiple files → consolidate related responsibilities.
8. **Divergent Change**: One class changes for multiple unrelated reasons → split into cohesive classes with single responsibilities.
9. **Speculative Generality**: Hooks, parameters, or abstractions built for hypothetical future needs → delete unused generic machinery.
10. **Message Chains**: Client navigates long chains (`a.b().c().d()`) → hide delegation or extract query.
11. **Middle Man**: Class merely delegates without adding value → remove delegate and call target directly.
12. **Refused Bequest**: Subclass rejects inherited methods/data → replace inheritance with composition.

## Reviewer Contract

The reviewer should read the issue, acceptance criteria, Alibaba Code Review's output, CI results, and the PR diff first. Pull more context only when needed.

## Proportional Performance & Reliability Checks

Scale the depth of performance review to the PR's Risk Level (do not prematurely optimize; do not ignore an obvious regression):

- **Low Risk**: Skip dedicated performance checks unless the diff introduces an obvious infinite loop or severe memory leak.
- **Medium Risk**: Check for obvious algorithmic regressions (e.g. $O(N^2)$ loops where $O(N)$ was standard), N+1 queries in modified routes/queries, missing caching where an existing project pattern supplies it, and resource cleanup.
- **High Risk**: Check concurrency limits, network timeouts and retries on external calls, queue payload sizes, lock contention/slow migrations, and deterministic failure-path resource cleanup.

## Merge Rule

CI remains a hard merge gate; this review does not replace it and is not the place to rerun or restate lint/static-analysis automation. Do not merge non-trivial work without a review record. If an automated or subagent reviewer stalls, post a manual expert review that states residual risk.
