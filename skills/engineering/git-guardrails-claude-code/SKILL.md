description: Set up Claude Code hooks to block dangerous git commands (force-push, direct push to protected branches, reset --hard, clean, branch -D, etc.) before they execute. Use when user wants to prevent destructive git operations, add git safety hooks, or block git push/reset in Claude Code.

# Setup Git Guardrails

Sets up a PreToolUse hook that intercepts and blocks a fixed list of destructive git commands before Claude executes them.

Source: adapted from [mattpocock/skills — misc/git-guardrails-claude-code](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/misc/git-guardrails-claude-code/SKILL.md), imported 2026-08-26. Upstream blocks **every** invocation of `git push`, including plain feature-branch pushes. This adaptation narrows that to force-push and direct pushes to protected branches only, because `system-level/core.md`'s git workflow requires routine feature-branch pushes for the standard worktree → branch → push → PR flow — blocking all pushes would make this repo's own workflow unusable. The rest of upstream's blocked-command list (reset --hard, clean -f/-fd, branch -D, bare checkout/restore) is unchanged.

## What Gets Blocked

- `git push` with `--force` / `--force-with-lease` / `-f`
- `git push` directly to `main`, `master`, or `staging`
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -f` / `git clean -fd`
- `git branch -D`
- `git checkout .` / `git restore .` (bare, discards uncommitted changes)

Routine `git push origin <feature-branch>` is **not** blocked.

When blocked, Claude sees a message telling it that it does not have authority to run the command.

## Steps

### 1. Ask scope

Ask the user: install for **this project only** (`.claude/settings.json`) or **all projects** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)?

### 2. Copy the hook script

The bundled script is at: [scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh](scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh)

Copy it to the target location based on scope:

- **Project**: `.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh`
- **Global**: `~/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh`

Make it executable with `chmod +x`.

### 3. Add hook to settings

Add to the appropriate settings file, merging into any existing `hooks.PreToolUse` array — don't overwrite other settings:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

(Project scope: use `"\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh"` instead.)

### 4. Ask about customization

Ask if the user wants to add or remove any protected branch names or patterns. Edit the copied script's `DANGEROUS_PATTERNS` array accordingly — every pattern must keep a literal `git <subcommand>` prefix (see note below), not a bare keyword.

### 5. Verify

Every pattern requires a literal `git <subcommand>` prefix, and the push patterns cap the character gap between `git push` and its flag/branch target to a short window. This is deliberate: an earlier version matched bare keywords like `push` and `reset --hard` anywhere in the command string, which false-positived on prose mentioning those words — e.g. a `gh issue create --body "..."` call whose body text described this very hook. Test both directions before trusting the hook in a new environment:

```bash
# Should exit 2 (BLOCKED) — real dangerous commands, one per pipe-test:
echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git push origin main"}}' | <path-to-script>
echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git reset --hard origin/main"}}' | <path-to-script>

# Should exit 0 (allowed) — routine push and prose that merely mentions these words:
echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git push origin feature/my-branch"}}' | <path-to-script>
echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"gh issue create --body \"discusses git push and main\""}}' | <path-to-script>
```

Then prove it fires live in-session: run a real (but harmless-context) `git push --force` or similar in the Bash tool and confirm the hook intercepts it with a `PreToolUse:Bash hook error`, per this repo's own `update-config`-style hook-construction discipline (pipe-test → `jq -e` schema check → live fire proof).
