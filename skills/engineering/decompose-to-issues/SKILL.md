# Decompose To Issues

Use decomposition as context control, not project-management ceremony.

## Workflow

1. Identify the user-visible or operational outcome.
2. Split by vertical slices that can be implemented, reviewed, and verified independently.
3. Put shared setup before dependent slices only when it unlocks multiple issues.
4. Mark dependencies explicitly. Check dependencies between issues: are they real, or are they artifacts of thinking horizontally?
   - **Real dependency**: Issue B cannot be compiled, tested, or deployed without Issue A's code or schema in the target branch (e.g. Issue B consumes an API contract introduced in Issue A).
   - **Horizontal artifact**: Dividing tasks by technical layer (e.g. Issue A for database migration, Issue B for API controller, Issue C for UI). Collapse these into vertical slices that deliver testable end-to-end functionality.
5. Target 3-7 issues for a typical plan. Fewer than 3 usually means slices are too fat; more than 7 usually means you are decomposing tasks instead of value. If a project genuinely requires more than 7 vertical slices, organize the work into milestone phases of 3-7 issues each, completing Phase 1 before decomposing Phase 2.
6. Keep each issue small enough for a fresh agent to complete in one focused pass when possible.

## Issue Shape

Each issue should include:

- Problem
- Acceptance criteria
- Verification plan
- Expected test layers
- Constraints / non-goals
- Links and relevant files
- Risk level

## Guardrails

- Avoid horizontal slices like "build backend" and "build frontend" unless the architecture truly requires it.
- Do not create issues that require inherited conversation context to understand.
- Create follow-up issues for scope discovered during implementation.
